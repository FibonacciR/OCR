London

London is the capital and
most populous city of
England and the United
Kingdom. Standing on the
River Thames in the south
east of the island of Great
Britain, London has been
a major settlement for two
millennia. It was founded
by the Romans, who
named it Londinium
London's ancient core, the
City of London, largely
retains its 1.12-square-
mile medieval boundaries.
Since at least the 19th century, London has also referred to the metropolis around this core,
historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely
makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.
